I was lucky enough to have good friends on the committee so never actually had to pay membership (shhhh...).<br>In my final year I had started teaching myself how to use Illustrator and decided to pay back the club by giving their logo a facelift.</p><p>I didn\'t want to venture too far away from the original so I used the same font (Arial, please forgive me!) and I re-drew the \'snowriders lady\' so that we would have it in a scalable format rather than just the heavily pixelated version that we already had.<br>I chose to take the one line \'snowriders\' and split this into two so that it would better fit on teeshirts and hoodies and chose a very bold look for easy recognition, the snowriders are a proud bunch!</p>'

So we went about prototyping a device (in place of the smartphone housing) and the web app that would display the data.</p><p>As this was more of a concept project than an actual attempt at building a product, I added some functionality that wouldn\'t really be achievable, such as real-time wave-to-wave updates to the surfers profile, where each wave would be plotted on a local map with it\'s speed and distance shown along side.</p><p>We didn\'t win any prizes but didn\'t do terrbily either as we were somewhere in the top 9 out of 40+ teams.</p>'

(We had roughly two weeks to hack on our final projects). However, as much as it was hardwork it was a lot of fun!</p><p>I learned a heap about Ruby on Rails in this time, particularly since there were some complex relationships going on between the different resources and entities in this game.</p><p>The project has since been laid to rest but I do still aim to find the time to re-build it with some extra features, such as using websockets and HTML5 canvas! - it\'d be a fun side project to have on the go!</p>'

As well as it having a fun cartoony style it presented a few simple but interesting challenges to overcome.</p> <p>The main challenge was the handling of the token redemptions, there were a number of different ways for a user to earn these tokens, through different on-pack and magazine codes and through facebook friend referals - certain sources were repeatable, others were not. Another challenge was to integrate a third party API that handled the validation of the promo codes - which turned out to have a couple of bugs!</p> '
